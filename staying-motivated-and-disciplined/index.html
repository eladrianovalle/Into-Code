<p>One of the greatest challenges I face in making this career change a reality is staying motivated in the face of the constant frustrations that come with learning these new languages and technologies.  And now that the winter is over and my usual jobs are picking back up, the anxious inclination to work constantly after some incredibly lean months makes it hard to maintain any semblance of discipline in my learning process.  This month has proven to be full of paying gigs and lacking in time for coding, and that brings with it both a great relief and an acute anxiety: knowing money is once more rolling in is comforting, yet the worry that I'm quickly getting off track is a constant weight on my mind.  In the last week I've been thinking a lot about what strategies I need to develop or reinstate in order to keep moving steadily toward my goal now that there are many more demands on my schedule, especially after my momentum is slowed by frustration.  </p>

<h2 id="maketime">Make Time</h2>

<p><img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5348b95ce4b095a3fb0b18f8/t/53b0c825e4b0d621f6aa8388/1404094495736/pinterest.com" alt="Make time!" title="">  </p>

<p>My dad always challenged me whenever I'd state that "I just don't have time to do it" by simply saying, "Well, make time!".  Obviously this maddened me as a teen, and I stubbornly resisted his advice, keeping a white-knuckled grip on my belief that I just did not have the time.  Years later, I now realize he was right.  </p>

<p>He always pointed out that the busiest people are also those who get the most things done.  In my own life I've noted that during times when I am the busiest, and seemingly lacking in time for much more than what's already on my plate, is also when I am the most productive, in so-called extra-curricular terms, whether creatively or simply in terms of taking care of errands or menial tasks.  Things need to get done and I find the time to do them.  With some planning I am able to fit much more into every day than I'd initially thought possble.  </p>

<p>Now I need to get back to setting time aside for my learning.  Pick one day a week to dedicate fully to coding and make it sacred, off limits, a project day.  No matter how tempting the job, no matter the pleas of my girlfriend to spend the day with her, no matter the lure of watching a <a href="http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80018294">new show on Netflix</a>, that day is for learning only.  Following the advice of a friend who already made this journey for himself, I block off the day, at least 8 consecutive hours, a facsimile of what a real workday will look like in my near future, make it a day spent immersed in code.  I've noticed that just like with painting or drawing, disciplines I'm familiar with, when coding, you first start slow as you warm up, but at some point you acheive a sort of flow, you get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqxVos5ZMcI">in the zone</a>, so to speak, and that's when the magic happens.</p>

<h2 id="doitdaily">Do It Daily</h2>

<p>After I set aside a day for coding, I also need to keep my momentum going from day to day.  This means doing some coding <a href="http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2009/02/jonathan-lethem-and-paul-auster.html">every day</a>, even if it isn't for a full 8 hours, even if it's just for a single hour a day, what matters is to do it every day.  This keeps me immersed, keeps what I'm learning in the forefront of my mind.  After all, this is my goal, to very soon code professionally, and that means doing it daily.  So why not start getting in the habit?</p>

<h2 id="quickwins">Quick Wins</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.kartoen.be/cartoons/happysad/attainable.jpg" alt="Quick wins" title="">  </p>

<p>I'm fortunate to know people who are programmers of some stripe who give me sage counsel from time to time during this challenging journey.  One friend gave me the very poignant advice to go for quick wins.  He pointed out that learning to code can be a Herculean task.  To keep your momentum in the face of any friction caused by the sheer size of the challenge, focus on small, easily attainable goals.  Then allow yourself to celebrate each success to propel yourself toward the next challenge with renewed conviction.  </p>

<h2 id="lovewhatyouredoing">Love What You're Doing</h2>

<p><img src="http://amonika.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/flat550x550075f.jpg" alt="Do what you love" title="">  </p>

<p>This one is easy, but often missed.  The idea is that if you do what you love, you'll have little trouble making time for it.  And when learning to code, which can be so hard, you'll have a even harder time if you find yourself hating it.  So make sure you love it, or find a way to love it, and it will make it easier to acheive your goals.  <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/internal-vs-external-motivation-how-to-build-an-exercise-routine-you-ll-stick-to-e5770979f223">This article</a> provides some great insight into creating lasting habits when you focus on internal motivations, on wanting to do a thing because you want it, because you enjoy it, not because you were told to do it.  Do what you love.  Period.</p>
