            <p>We all have to start somewhere.  This isn't the beginning.  It started somewhere else, in another time, but here I am now.  This part of my journey began exactly 2 years ago this month ( I was surprised to learn today! ) on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/adrtk">Codecademy</a>, with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/adrtk">me</a> running through their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tracks.  </p>

<p>As I often do, I started at the finish line, diving into JavaScript first; it was like diving into concrete.  I mean, I got through the exercises, enjoying the acheivements; I decoded each challenge, akin to solving a puzzle in a video game, using my wits to unlock the next stage, but without retaining any knowledge.  I wasn't 'getting' it.  It was too foreign to me.</p>

<p>I finally got through JavaScript, winded after the struggle, and decided to take their HTML &amp; CSS track next.  This seemed easier.  It brought me back to other beginnings, college days in the late 90s spent tinkering with <a href="http://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/">Geocities</a> pages, embedding images and midi files, creating garish inline styles to 'jazz' up my site.  I knew this stuff, or at least the concepts.  It got more fun.    </p>

<p>Now I felt like I was starting to understand.  It wasn't all gibberish.  I was living the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVVURiaVgG8">campfire montage</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_13th_Warrior">The 13th Warrior</a>, in which Antonio Banderas learns the language of the Vikings ( turned out to be English! ).  Out of the haze, objects came into focus.  The tumblers were clicking into place, understanding soon to be unlocked.  Or so I thought.</p>

<p>The next track I embarked upon was jQuery.  I hadn't really understood JavaScript, but as I went through the lessons in jQuery, the operations became clearer, it was easier to see what was going on.  With simpler logic on the surface, the structures became more apparent.  </p>

<p>Yet upon completion of these 3 tracks, although I felt more knowledgeable in talking about these concepts, I still hadn't gained much perspective on how to use these concepts outside of their sandbox.  I needed something more...</p>
